virtual-node
============

This package is a wrapper around the `node.js`_ sources and provides a
convenient way to install it directly into your ``virtualenv`` instead
of globally. I created this package to play around with a simple 
installation for Django projects that use `django-compressor`_'s
precompiler to generate CSS from `less`_ files.

The install routine used in ``setup.py`` is adapted from the
`nodeenv`_ package provided by Eugene Kalinin. The difference is that I want
to install node.js into an existing ``virtualenv`` instead of creating
a specific environment for node.

I am using this in combination with `virtual-less`_ which installs the
``lessc`` commandline tool into a virtual environment.

Installation
------------

Installing the ``node`` into your virtual environment is as easy as::

    $ pip install virtual-node

that should be it. You should now be able to run ``node`` from within
your virtual environment even if you have it globally installed. You
can make sure that this is the case::

    $ which node
    /home/elbaschid/.virtualenvs/lessc-test/bin/node
